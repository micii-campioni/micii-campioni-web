**Subject:** Micii Campioni - Website review & ideas to make it stand out

---

Hi,

The website is in great shape — the structure, design, and content are all coming together nicely. Before we move towards launch, I wanted to share a few observations and ideas that I think could really elevate the site and help convert more visitors into enquiries and enrolments.

I've split everything below into priorities so you can decide what's worth pursuing now versus later.

### Before launch (critical)

**Contact form email delivery**
The contact form on the site looks and works great from a visitor's perspective, but the emails aren't actually being delivered yet on the backend. We'll get this wired up — just wanted to flag it so you know no messages have been lost. We'll need to confirm which email address(es) should receive the form submissions.

### High impact suggestions

These are the changes I think would make the biggest difference in helping parents choose Micii Campioni.

**1. Floating WhatsApp or phone button**
Parents researching swimming lessons for their child often want to speak to someone right away. A small floating button in the corner of every page — linking to WhatsApp or a direct phone call — would make it effortless for them to reach you. This is one of the highest-converting features for service businesses, especially those working with children.

**2. Video on the homepage**
A short looping video (even 15–30 seconds) of children in the pool, an instructor at work, or a group session would immediately communicate what Micii Campioni is about. Nothing sells aquatic education quite like seeing happy, confident kids in the water. This could replace or complement the image carousel at the top of the homepage. If you have any video footage from sessions or events, even phone recordings, we can work with it.

**3. Animated statistics**
The site already has a stats section (years of experience, children trained, etc.), but we could make the numbers count up as visitors scroll to them. It's a small touch that draws the eye and makes those numbers feel more impactful.

**4. "How old is your child?" — interactive service finder**
Parents visiting the site are usually looking for one thing: the right program for their child's age. Instead of asking them to read through all the services, we could add a simple interactive element near the top of the homepage — they select their child's age bracket and are immediately shown the relevant program. It removes friction and gets them to the right information faster.

**5. Video testimonials**
If any parents would be willing to record a short clip (even on their phone) about their experience, a video testimonial is worth far more than a written one. We could feature one or two prominently on the homepage. Written testimonials still work well, but video builds trust faster — especially when parents are making decisions about their children.

### Medium impact suggestions

These would strengthen the site and improve the overall experience.

**6. Parent FAQ sections on service pages**
Parents have very specific concerns — water temperature, safety procedures, what to bring, group sizes, instructor qualifications. Adding a short FAQ accordion directly on each service page answers these questions before they become barriers. It also helps with search engine rankings since these are exactly the kinds of questions people type into Google.

**7. Google Maps instead of OpenStreetMap**
The contact page currently uses an OpenStreetMap embed. Switching to Google Maps would feel more familiar to most visitors and make it easier for them to tap "Get Directions" on their phone.

**8. "Book a Trial Session" button**
A clear, prominent call-to-action on every page — something like "Book a Trial Session" or "Schedule a Visit" — would give visitors an obvious next step. Even if it just links to a phone number, WhatsApp, or a simple booking form, having that button visible at all times creates a clear path from browsing to action.

**9. Instagram feed**
If Micii Campioni has an active Instagram account, embedding the latest posts on the homepage shows that the club is active and thriving. Parents trust businesses with fresh, real content — it signals that the community is alive.

**10. Progress stories**
A section showcasing a child's journey — from first nervous session to confident swimmer — would resonate deeply with parents. It could be as simple as a few photos with short captions, or a parent's quote describing their child's experience over time.

### Nice to have (post-launch)

These aren't urgent but would add polish and long-term value.

**11. Cookie consent banner**
Required under GDPR, especially since the site collects form data and works with children. We should add this before or shortly after launch.

**12. Blog or news section**
Articles like "When should my baby start swimming?" or "How aquatic education supports early development" would attract parents through Google searches over time. Great for long-term visibility, but not essential for launch.

**13. Analytics (Google Analytics or similar)**
We should set up basic visitor tracking so you can see how many people visit the site, which pages they look at, and how many submit the contact form. This helps measure whether the site is working and where to focus improvements.

**14. English language option**
If expat families in Bucharest are part of your audience, even a basic English version of key pages could widen your reach.

### What we need from you

To move forward on any of the above, it would help to know:

1. **Which email address(es)** should receive contact form submissions?
2. **Do you have any video footage** from sessions, events, or activities — even informal phone recordings?
3. **Do you have a WhatsApp Business number** or would you prefer a direct call button?
4. **Which of the suggestions above interest you?** Happy to discuss any of them in more detail.

No pressure to decide on everything at once — let us know what catches your eye and we'll take it from there.

Best regards
