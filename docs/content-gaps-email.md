**Subject:** Micii Campioni - New website: materials needed from you

---

Hello,

The Micii Campioni website is under development and looking good. The text content has been mostly added, but we need a few materials from you to finalize it.

Below is a list of everything that's missing, organized by priority.

---

### 1. Hero images for pages (high priority)

Each page of the website has a large banner at the top (1920 x 600px, landscape). Currently no page has this image. We need good quality photos for the main pages:

- **About Us** - group photo, club exterior or an activity
- **Concept** - babies in the pool / aquatic education
- **The Association** - official club photo
- **History** - photo from the early years of activity
- **Team** - group photo with the team
- **Awards and Certifications** - award ceremonies or display of certificates
- **Safety and Security** - a supervised session or safety equipment
- **Mission** - children in the water
- **Conferences and Congresses** - presentation at a conference
- **Contact** - club exterior or reception area

We also need similar images for the service pages:

- **Aquatic Education** - children swimming with instructors
- **Sultana Method** - massage or hydrotherapy session with a newborn
- **Parents' School** - prenatal course or parents with newborns
- **Aquatic Activity for Pregnant Women** - pregnant women in the pool
- **Physiotherapy** - therapy session with a child

If you have a folder with photos from activities, you can send us the entire folder and we'll select the most suitable ones.

### 2. Team photos (medium priority)

Currently we only have one team member on the site. We still need:

- **Simina Angelescu** - portrait photo
- **Instructor Team** - group photo

The biographical texts are already prepared. Please confirm if they are correct and we will update them.

---

### 3. Certificates (medium priority)

We've added 3 certificates (OSIM, FAAEL, Ministry of Health). We have 11 more certificate images that we cannot identify from the photos.

We will send you the 11 images separately. For each one, we need:
- **Certificate title**
- **Who issued it** (the institution)
- **Date** (if you know it)
- **A short description** (1-2 sentences)

---

### 4. Press appearances (medium priority)

We have 20 images of press articles, but only 2 have been added to the site. For the remaining 18, we need:
- **Article title**
- **Publication** (newspaper/magazine name)
- **Publication date**

We will send these images separately as well.

---

### 5. Legal pages (mandatory before launch)

We've created the "Terms and Conditions" and "Privacy Policy" pages. These need to be reviewed by a lawyer or legal consultant before launch, particularly:

- Cancellation policy (currently mentions 24h notice)
- Data retention periods (GDPR)
- Children's data protection
- Association identification details (CUI/CIF - if you can send them to us, we'll add them)

---

### 6. Other elements (low priority)

- **Historical partners** - SC Bostina, Exim Bank, FRAA, CNA Posta Romana - if you have their logos, we'll add them. If not, we can omit them.
- **Service icons** - small icons for each service (we can generate these ourselves if you prefer)

---

### How to send us the materials

Easiest way: a Google Drive folder or WeTransfer with all the photos. They don't need to be perfectly organized - we'll sort them ourselves.

For the information about certificates and press, a simple Word document or email with the details is sufficient.

If you have any questions or would like to discuss, don't hesitate to contact us.

Thank you!
